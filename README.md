You can configure, repair... system with a few options.

Be careful! These initial versions has a lot of bugs and disabled functionalities.

If you want to help on this dev, say to me.

If you need help about compilation and packaging I have basic notions, ask me.

TO DO
=============================================

Implement code to generate new apps automatically to save a bunch of code lines.

Load saved configurations of personalized user installations.

Be care
=============================================

I'm not a senior programmer, nor junior. I program as a hobby. So I'm not following professional coding practises.

I know that my code is horrifying and not good implemented. With patience I'll go to improving it.

All experienced help are welcome.
